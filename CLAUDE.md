## Must do

1. always do typescript lint check at the end of execution to make sure all files build successfully

2. be succinct and structure about the code style. don't emit, write trash and redundant, extra code

3. Font will be using `Distek Mono` and dark theme, electric, stylish but simple. Do not use rounded corners on buttons and inputs. Scale buttons on X and Y position and tranform them when they are hovered on, change to opposite color theme when they are clicked on.

4. check with convex documentation via context7 and deepwiki to see how to use convex within the `/convex` folder before implementation.

5. use context7 and deepwiki to check how to use Vapi to have both web calls and phone calls

6. use context7 and deepwiki to have a good understanding of model context protocol, A2A protocol

7. use context7 and deepwiki to understand vercel AI sdk, vercel's AI SDK UI to implement elegant frontend

8. use context7 and deepwiki to understand streaming

9. use context7 and deepwiki to understand Resend and how to send email to users and what environment variable we need

10. use context7 and deepwiki to understand how to use Polar (https://polar.sh) to charge users and what environment variable we need

11. do not use env var in code base. never use env var in codebase, always use `process.env.something-var`

Refer to implementation plan in `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

Always run `pnpm build` to test if there is problem with production deployment
